## Super Hero Lab: A Walkthrough

*For this post, I decided to record a walkthrough of one of Flatiron's Sinatra Labs. Full disclosure, I had already made my way through the whole lab before recording this walkthrough, so I already had a good idea of what I was doing. However, I tried to demonstrate my workflow and the thought processes that I actually had when working through the lab, while simultaneously cutting out the stumbling I did as I tried to make sense of it on the first pass.*

My walkthrough is uploaded [here](https://youtu.be/8iMMmBkXxbo),
and you can take a look at my completed code [here](https://github.com/oconnojb/sinatra-nested-forms-lab-superheros-v-000)!
