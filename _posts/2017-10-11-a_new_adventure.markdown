The first day I sat down and started learning to code, I was almost late to work. Work, at that time, was as an elementary music teacher, part time. I was surrounded by older, competant teachers. Some had been at the school for over twenty years. Twenty years doing the same thing, just with a different set of students. They seemed trapped. I didn't want that. But what do I want?

I want something that can afford me more opportunities. I want to be continuiously learning new things, and learning how to apply them in new ways. I want a career path that has more than one job opening in a given town. I want to have a higher earning potential so I can afford to do the things I love. I want a job that I enjoy doing.

A friend of mine had recently graduated from Flatiron, though at the time I didn't know it by name. We had been working together at a summer camp when she was first accepted, and while I stayed on for another session of camp, she moved to NYC. When she came to visit the camp before the session ended, I asked her how it was going. "It's hard, but fun. I'm glad I won't have to go back to teaching next year." 

So, when I felt like I didn't want to go back to teaching next year, I recalled her comments. Maybe coding was something I would like doing too? I decided to learn some and see if it was the right path for me. 

I started with a free, online program called Free Code Camp. I knew going in that, even if I liked it, this wouldn't be a permanent solution. I've never been a big risk taker, and it seemed really risky to try and acquire the necessary skills to find a job in this new field based only on a free program, but it would be a good place to start. I sat down and began my first escapade into HTML and CSS.

As luck would have it, I glanced up at the clock just minutes before I was supposed to leave for work. I hadn't checked the time in two hours. I think I'm going to like this.
